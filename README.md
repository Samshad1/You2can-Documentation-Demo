## Recommendations
Based on the analysis:
- We encourage a deeper dive to understand the imports from benin as it is not an alcohol producing nation.
- Access to paid databases will help for more in-dept analysis, which will aid informed decision making. It is recommended that the company looks into subscribing for one or more, that meets its business requirements or current need.
- Explore potential for local substitutes in high-import categories (e.g., spirits).
